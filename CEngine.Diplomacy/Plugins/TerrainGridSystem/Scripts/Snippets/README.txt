***********************************
* TERRAIN GRID SYSTEM'S SNIPPETS! *
***********************************


What's a snippet?
-----------------
It's a short reusable script that interacts with Terrain Grid System API for a single specific action, for example, move a gameobject over a cell.


How do I use a snippet?
-----------------------
Snippets are scripts that start with "TGS" prefix. Just select a gameobject and add one of those scripts to the object.
Once they're added to the gameobject, the snippets are self-explained in the inspector


Can I suggest a new snippet?
----------------------------
Yes. Please contact us by email with your request and we'll add the snipper to TGS!
